        <b>2. Set in Order (Seiton)</b> <br />
        <br />
        Set in Order is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for
        fulfilling their function in the workplace.
        <br />
        The second step is to set it in order. This step involves organizing the
        necessary items logically and systematically. This includes assigning a
        specific location for each item and labeling them for easy
        identification. This helps to reduce search time and eliminate the need
        for excess inventory.
        <br />

        <i>Goals:</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        > Make the workflow smooth and easy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Implementation:</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        > Arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling/equipment is in
        close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted
        to the work performed. <br />> Place components according to their uses,
        with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace.
        <br />> Arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected
        for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items. <br />>
        Assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so
        that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is
        easy to spot missing items.
