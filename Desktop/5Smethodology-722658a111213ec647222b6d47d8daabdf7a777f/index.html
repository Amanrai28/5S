      <p>
        5S is a system for organizing spaces so work can be performed
        efficiently, effectively, and safely. This system focuses on putting
        everything where it belongs and keeping the workplace clean, which makes
        it easier for people to do their jobs without wasting time or risking
        injury.
        <br />
        <br />
        5S, sometimes referred to as 5s or Five S, refers to five Japanese terms
        used to describe the steps of the 5S system of visual management. Each
        term starts with an S. In Japanese, the five S's are Seiri, Seiton,
        Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke. In English, the five S's are translated
        as Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.

       <div id="sort"> <b>1. Sort (Seiri)</b> <br />
        <br />
        Seiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all
        unnecessary items from the location.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Goals:</i> <br />
        <br />
        > Reduce time loss looking for an item by reducing the number of
        unnecessary items. <br />
        > Reduce the chance of distraction by unnecessary items. <br />
        > Simplify inspection. <br />
        > Increase the amount of available, useful space. <b></b>> Increase
        safety by eliminating obstacles. <br />
        <br />
        <i>Implementation:</i> <br />
        <br />
        > Check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their
        presence at the location is useful or necessary. <br />
        > Remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. <br />
        > Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a 'red tag area' so
        that they are easy to remove later on. <br />
        > Keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in
        use for production. <br />
